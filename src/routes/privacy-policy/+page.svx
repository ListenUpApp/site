# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** December 28, 2025
**Last Updated:** December 28, 2025

Calypsan Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") provides ListenUp, a self-hosted audiobook server and client application. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with the ListenUp mobile application available on Google Play.

## The Simple Truth

ListenUp is a self-hosted application. This means:

- **Your server, your data.** All audiobook files, listening progress, user accounts, and personal information are stored on servers that you own and operate.
- **We never see your data.** The ListenUp app connects directly to your self-hosted server. We do not operate any intermediate servers, and your data never passes through our systems.
- **We don't collect analytics.** The app contains no tracking, analytics, or telemetry that reports back to us.

## Information We Collect

**We collect no personal information through the ListenUp application.**

The app does not:
- Collect or transmit usage analytics
- Track your listening habits
- Access your contacts, location, or other device data
- Include third-party advertising or tracking SDKs
- Require account creation with Calypsan Inc.

## Information Stored on Your Server

When you use ListenUp with a self-hosted server, that server stores information necessary for the application to function, including:

- User account credentials (stored with industry-standard encryption)
- Audiobook metadata and files
- Listening progress and bookmarks
- Application preferences

**This data is entirely under your control.** You determine where it's stored, who has access, and how long it's retained. We have no access to your server or its contents.

## Information Stored on Your Device

The ListenUp app stores data locally on your device to enable offline listening and improve performance:

- Downloaded audiobook files
- Cached cover artwork
- Authentication tokens for your server connection
- Local playback preferences

This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to us.

## Third-Party Services

The ListenUp app may optionally connect to third-party services for metadata enrichment (such as book information and cover art). These connections are:

- Initiated only at your request
- Made directly from your device or server to the third-party service
- Subject to the privacy policies of those respective services

We do not receive any information from these interactions.

## Children's Privacy

ListenUp does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13. Since all data is stored on user-controlled servers, parents and guardians maintain complete control over any information related to children in their household.

## Data Security

Because ListenUp is self-hosted, data security is in your hands. The application implements security best practices including:

- Encrypted authentication tokens
- Secure password storage using Argon2
- HTTPS support for server connections

We recommend following security best practices for your self-hosted server.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date and, where appropriate, through the application or our website.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect your data, there's nothing for us to provide, correct, or delete. You have complete control over your data on your own server.

*ListenUp is built on a simple principle: your audiobooks, your server, your data. We believe privacy isn't a feature—it's a right.*
